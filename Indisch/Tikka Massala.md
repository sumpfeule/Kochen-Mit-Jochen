Instructions:
1. Prepare Tikka Masala Spice Blend by combining cumin, paprika, curry powder, garam masala, and chile flake in a bowl. Stir.

2. Place chicken thighs in a medium bowl. Add half of the tikka masala spice blend, a drizzle of olive oil, Greek yogurt, salt, lemon juice, garlic, and ginger. Mix well to coat. Marinate in the fridge for 15 minutes, but ideally 1 hour

3. Grate onion, garlic, and ginger. Dice the serrano Chile.

4. In a heavy-bottomed pot, melt ghee or oil over medium heat. 
Add grated onion, garlic, ginger, and diced serrano. Sprinkle with a strong pinch of salt and sauté until fragrant and softened, about 2-3 minutes Add the remaining half of the tikka masala spice blend and toast the spices for about a minute. Stir in the crushed tomatoes and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Turn the heat to low and simmer for about 2 minutes until slightly thickened.  Stir in salt, sugar, and heavy cream 

5. Preheat the grill to its highest setting. Oil the grates well to prevent sticking. Grill the marinated chicken thighs for 5-6 minutes. Flip chicken over with a spatula and continue to cook and char for 2-3 minutes on the second side. 

6. Chop the grilled chicken into bite-sized pieces. Stir the chopped chicken into the masala gravy. If the gravy is too thick, add a splash of water to achieve the desired consistency.
