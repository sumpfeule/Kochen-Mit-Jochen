- 1 Hühnchen (ca 1.5 kg)
- 1 1/2 TL Black Pepper
- 1  EL  Liebstöckel
- 1 1/2 TL Kümmel
- 3 EL Fischsosse
-  250ml Rotwein
- ¾ TL Teufesdreck
- 60 ml warmes Wasser

METHOD
1. Spatchcock your chicken and place in an oven safe dish. (It can be left in the refrigerator overnight to dry out which will result in a crispier skin)
2. Preheat your oven to 230°C. 
3. Mix the lovage, ground black pepper, caraway seeds, garum, and wine in a bowl and pour it over the chicken. Dissolve the asafoetida in lukewarm water in a separate bowl and pour over the chicken. 
4. Bake the chicken for 40-45 minutes or until an instant read thermometer measures 74°C. To prevent drying, you can baste the chicken several times during cooking, though this is not required. 
5. When the chicken is cooked, remove it from the oven and allow it to rest for 10 minutes. Then serve with the sauce is was cooked in and ground pepper.
