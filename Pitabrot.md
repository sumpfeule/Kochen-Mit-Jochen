300g Mehl
85g Milch
85g Wasser
20g  Olivenöl
13g  Zucker
7.5g  Salz
7.5g Trockenhefe

## Directions:
1. Add the water and milk to a jug and check the temperature. If it's cold warm it up to room temperature and no hotter
2. Add the sugar and yeast to the milk and stir to combine. Allow to sit for 10-15 minutes to bloom
3. After 10-15 minutes check if the yeast has activated and a frothy layer exists, if not your yeast is dead and the dough will not rise
4. Add the flour and salt to your mixing bowl, and mix briefly to combine
5. Make a well in the centre and add the yeast mixture and the oil. Use the dough hook attachment on your stand mixer or your hands to combine the yeast and flour together into a shaggy dough ball
6. Knead on low speed for 8-10 minutes with the mixer or 12-15 by hand until the dough ball is smooth and soft. It should be only a tiny bit sticky to the hand
7. Oil a bowl lightly then add your dough to the bowl, ensure there is space for it to double in size. Cover with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel and allow it to rise for 1 hour
8. After one hour flour your worktop and place the risen dough on it. Knock out the air and cut into the desired number of pieces
9. Weigh your pieces to ensure they are all equally sized, then roll the dough into balls. Keep them covered until needed
10. Flour your worktop then flatten a dough ball on it. Use a rolling pin to roll the dough out to the correct size in one direction. Turn it 90 degrees and roll the other way
11. Allow your dough to rise for between 15-30 minutes before cooking
Note: If you are working with more than 12 pieces of dough, I do not recommend rolling them all out at once. After they have sat and risen for more then 40 minutes without cooking they will over proof and you'll have to re-roll them and wait for them to rise again otherwise they will fail to inflate. Work in batches while the rest are cooking.

To cook Pitta in the oven:
1. Preheat your oven to it's hottest temperature with fan
2. Place a pizza stone or steel in the middle of your oven, or use an oven tray by placing it upside down. Allow the oven to preheat fully with the tray inside
3. Once heated, toss on a rolled out pitta. I prefer doing 1 at a time but you can do multiple if you want to speed things up
4. Cook until it puffs up, and a brown ring forms around the edge. In my oven at 240c this took 3 minutes and a half. I would recommend testing a single pitta first to figure out your exact timing on the temperature you use.
5. Remove the pitta once browned and immediately place on a tray or plate. Cover with a kitchen towel and allow to rest before serving
