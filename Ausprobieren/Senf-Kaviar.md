## How to Make It

It couldn’t be easier to make! You simply take 1 tbsp. dry mustard seeds, and soak them in 3 tbsp. of your desired sauce. Allow the mustard seeds to absorb the sauce or liquid for a full 5 days, giving it a stir from time to time to make sure it absorbs evenly.

Keep in mind, some liquids absorb better than others, and you may need to add a little extra sauce than 3 tbsp. For example, I notice sriracha absorbs quickly and deeply into the seeds, and I often need to add a little bit more than 3 tbsp. But for balsamic vinegar, 3 tbsp. seems to be just about right.

Also note, you can’t add too much liquid to your mustard seeds. They’ll simply absorb what they can, and remain a lovely texture, even if they are sitting in a puddle of your sauce.
