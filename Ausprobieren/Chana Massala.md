Kabuli Chana
Garam Massala



1.5 cups (500g) dried kabuli chana (or other chickpeas) 
1 large onion 
2-4 fresh chiles 
3-4 fresh tomatoes (or a 14 oz, 400g can of crushed tomatoes) 
half a head of garlic 
1 large thumb of ginger 
5-10 green cardamom pods 
2-3 bay leaves 
1 tablespoon garam masala 
1 teaspoon onion powder 
1 teaspoon garlic powder 
1 teaspoon dried ginger

tomato paste 
ground amchoor or lemon juice 
salt 
sugar 
ghee (or of oil) 

Soak the chickpeas for at least a few hours, then boil with a teaspoon of salt until just tender. Put the cumin, coriander seeds, peppercorns, mustard seeds, fenugreek seeds, black cardamom and cinnamon stick into a dry pan and toast over medium heat until fragrant. Cool and grind to a fine powder. Peel and roughly chop the onion, garlic and ginger. Roughly chop the tomato and chiles. Heat some ghee in your widest pan over medium heat and fry your fresh-ground masala along with the turmeric until fragrant. Add the garlic and ginger and fry for a moment, then all the rest of the chopped vegetables. Cook, stirring constantly, until enough water has evaporated that things are staring to brown. Deglaze the pan with a little water, then puree the contents. If you want a smooth sauce, push it through a fine mesh strainer. Clean the pan, head some more ghee and fry the green cardamom pods and the bay leaves until fragrant. Put in about a tablespoon of tomato paste and fry it for moment before stirring in the pureed sauce. Stir in the cooked chickpeas along with as much cooking water as you want for the sauce texture you like, and simmer for about 15 minutes. Stir in amchoor powder (or lemon juice), salt, a pinch of sugar and fresh cilantro to taste. Remove the bay leaves and serve over basmati rice.
