# Tortillas, Joghurt
320 grams of flour, sifted
3 grams of salt
5g sugar
200 milliliters yogurt
Stir with a spoon. Knead the dough by hand. 
30 ml olive oil.  Knead the dough until the oil is absorbed.  (2 EL)

Cover the dough and let it rest for 15 minutes. 
Sprinkle the table with flour and divide the dough into 10 parts. Make dough balls. Keep the dough covered while you work with it. Roll out the dough thinly to the size of your pan. Work with flour at this stage so that the dough does not stick to the table. Roll out the dough thinly to the size of your pan. Remove excess dough. Heat up a skillet over medium heat. Add pita bread to the pan and in the meantime roll out the next one. After 40-60 seconds, flip the flatbread to the other side. Cook in a dry skillet without oil for about 2 minutes. Brush the hot bread with hot water on both sides. Cover with a food bag so that the flatbread is steamed. Roll out the dough thinly, about 2 millimeters thick. The working diameter of my frying pan is 25 centimeters (10 inches). The main thing is not to overdry thin bread. Sometimes the dough may puff up in some places - it's normal. Brush the flat bread with water, grease the edges especially well. When all the tortillas are cooked, cover them for 30 minutes, let them steam evenly. Thin bread is ideal as a base for tacos, tortillas, quesadillas or kebabs. It is delicious with jam and honey, as well as with meat or salad.
