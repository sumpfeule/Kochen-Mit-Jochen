P.F. Chang’s Dark Sauce:

Ingredients: 
½ tsp. (2.5 grams) Knorr or Lee Kum Kee chicken broth powder
¼ cup (50 grams) sugar
¼ cup (60 ml) water

¼ cup + 2 tbsp. (90 ml) Lee Kum Kee low sodium soy sauce (green bottle) or Kikkoman soy sauce
1 tbsp. (15 ml) Lee Kum Kee mushroom soy sauce
1 tbsp (19 grams) Lee Kum Kee Panda brand oyster sauce (green bottle) or Lee Kum Kee premium oyster sauce (preferably) 
2 tbsp (30 ml) Michiu rice cooking wine (preferably) or Shaoxing cooking wine

Directions:
Add chicken bouillon and sugar to a small pot with water. 
Bring to a light simmer and whisk until dry ingredients are dissolved. 
Remove from heat, add remaining ingredients, and whisk until dissolved. 
The sauce can be stored covered in the refrigerator for up to 1 month. 

Note: P.F. Chang’s currently uses Lee Kum Kee low sodium soy sauce (green bottle), Lee Kum Kee mushroom sauce, and Lee Kum Kee Panda brand oyster sauce (green bottle). In the past, they used Kikkoman soy sauce. So, it’s really up to you. I also recommend trying to track down Lee Kum Kee's premium oyster sauce because I believe it is superior to the green bottle.
