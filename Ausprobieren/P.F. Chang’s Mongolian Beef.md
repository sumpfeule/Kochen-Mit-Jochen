1 tbsp. (12.5 grams) white sugar
12 oz. (340 grams) prepared flank steak (pages 3-4)

Note: P.F. Chang’s uses dehydrated, minced garlic. You should be able to find this in the spice aisle at your local grocery store. To reconstitute, cover the amount of garlic needed with water for 20-30 minutes. Then strain, pressing out the extra water. Once reconstituted, the garlic can be used immediately or kept in the fridge for up to 1 week.
