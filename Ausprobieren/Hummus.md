Makes about 1 kg of Hummus (scale down if needed):
500g Dried Chickpeas
250g Tahini
70-100g ice
75ml Lemon Juice
2 Tsp Salt
1 Tsp Baking Soda
Citric acid (optional)

For Beiruty Hummus:
1 Cup Hummus
2 Tbsp Parsley
1 Tsp Mint
1 Clove Garlic
2 Tbsp Lemon Juice
1/2 Tsp Chilli flakes
_
Directions:

To prepare the chickpeas:
 1- Add your dry chickpeas to a bowl and completely submerge with water. Allow them to soak for 8-12h or overnight
 2- Rinse your chickpeas, then add to a pot with the baking soda. Pour water over the chickpeas to cover them by about 2 inches
 3- Turn the heat up to high and bring the pot to a boil. When the chickpeas foam up, stir the foam back into the pot and turn the heat to medium.
 4- Cook for half an hour, then remove some of the chickpeas and set aside to use as a garnish later
 5- Place a lid on your pot and cook the chickpeas for another 30-60 minutes on medium
 6- The chickpeas are done cooking when they are extremely soft and have burst. They should mash very easily and the skins should have dissolved
 7- Allow any extra water to evaporate away
 8- Pour the cooked chickpeas onto a plate, and allow it to cool completely until room temp (You can freeze these and defrost them whenever you want hummus)

To make the hummus:
 1- Add your prepared chickpeas to a food processor or blender, and process for 3-4 minutes, scraping down the side of the bowl halfway, until the chickpeas are processed into a super fine paste. If this is lumpy, you need to process longer. Feel it between your fingers and it should be floury
 2- Add 70g of ice into the food processor, and process into the chickpeas until light and fluffy
 3- Now add the tahini and mix it in. Then when that has been fully incorporated add the lemon juice
 4- You can now adjust to your desired acidity/thickness by adding citric acid or more ice
 5- Store in the fridge for up to a week

To make Beiruty Hummus:
 1- Finely chop the parsley and mint
 2- Add all the ingredients into a bowl and mix well

To serve hummus:
 1- Place a pile on a plate or bowl
 2- Use the inside of the spoon to build the hummus up into a mound, while rotating the plate
 3- Use the back of the spoon to push the hummus outwards and create the classic well shape
 4- Add your toppings such as chickpeas, then pour in olive oil

To use canned chickpeas:
 1- Wash the chickpeas thoroughly then add to the pot with the baking soda
Bring to a boil, then cook from step 5 onwards
